               PARAGRAPH
<h2>1.What is climate change?</h2> Climate change is the change of climate on earth when bad things happen to earth and us. It is caused by humans not protecting the environment .
<h2>2.Why is it bad?</h2> The global challenges we face are so urgent and tricky that we need a solution to match their scale and complexity. This is where system change comes in. We use systems thinking to understand the web of interrelations that create complex problems, anticipate unintended consequences, and identify how and where to take action. Systems thinking teaches you to see how individuals, places, businesses, actions, and innovations are interconnected. It is our way to respond to a complex, changing world. 
<h2>3.How do we stop it?</h2>    “Globally, economic and population growth continued to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion.”

    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014

There are multiple drivers of climate change, amongst which population is only one. Overwhelmingly, emissions are produced by people in the richest countries, and industrial development and consumption patters in the Global North are primarily responsible for the crisis we are in today. Technological solutions, personal lifestyle changes, policies to end fossil fuel use and develop alternative energy and potentially fundamental changes to our economic sytems are all vital, especially as the timescale for preventing catastrophic climate change is so short - now less than a decade, according to the IPCC. 

Whatever other changes we make, however, their positive impacts will be reduced and may even be completely cancelled out by adding emissions from hundreds of millions of new people as our population increases. Meanwhile, solutions such as reforestation may be more difficult to implement with more people needing food and land.

Reducing the number of people being born is not a panacea for climate change, but it cuts future carbon emissions, effectively, simply and permanently, and it boosts the effectiveness of other solutions.
<h2>3A.Make sure it never happens again!</h2> Topline findings of the survey of over 1400 nationally-representative adults in October 2019 include the fact that climate change was ranked the second most important issue facing the UK - up from 13th place in 2016. Climate concern has doubled in the past four years, with 40% saying they were now ‘very or extremely’ worried. 75% of survey respondents supported using public money now to prepare the UK for climate risks.

But how do we move from concern to action, particularly in the run-up to the UN climate summit? To accompany our

, we’re releasing a guide which highlights the importance of effective public engagement for progress on climate adaptation. It provides seven practical, evidence-based recommendations for communicators and practitioners working to engage the public on climate risks and adaptation.

Press coverage includes:

: Climate concerns grow amid wettest February on record
: Public opinion on climate change is up but let's not forget lessons from the past
: Climate change vying with Brexit as top UK concern - survey
: Twice as many UK citizens worried about climate change as 3 years ago
: Top UK worry? Climate change rises up to challenge Brexit
: Climate change rivalling Brexit for most important issue facing UK

: Climate change vying with Brexit as top UK concern – survey

Launch event

The survey results and public engagement recommendations were announced at a launch event at the Royal Society in London on 3 March 2020. Prof Nick Pidgeon, Dr Kat Steentjes and Dr Adam Corner presented key findings and recommendations. They were followed by Anna Beswick who shared how Adaptation Scotland is engaging Scottish communities on climate adaptation, and Keith Jones who spoke about how The National Trust is engaging their members around adaptation.</p>
